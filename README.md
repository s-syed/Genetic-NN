# Genetic-NN

This is my project for my CPSC 540, a graduate course in machine learning. 

In this we develop a genetic algorithm approach to learn the optimal structure of a Neural net as opposed to manual fine tuning and to create an ensemble classifier. We then apply the technique to a subset MNIST database in Matlab
